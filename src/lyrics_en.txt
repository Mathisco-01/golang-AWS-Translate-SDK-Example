Dreams of lovers are like good wine
They give joy or grief
Weakened by hunger I'm unhappy
Flying on the way everything I can
Because nothing is free in life
Hope is a dish too fast consumed
To skip meals I'm used to
A lonely thief is sad to feed
Has a game so bitter I can't succeed
Because nothing is free in...
Life... I will never be told
That the race to the stars; it's not for me
Let me marvel you and take my flight
We will in the end feast
Take out the bottles; no more trouble
The party will finally begin
I set the table, of my new life
I'm happy at the idea of this new destiny
A life to hide and then free finally
The feast is on my way
A life to hide and then free finally
The feast is on my way
